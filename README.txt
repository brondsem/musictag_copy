This is a Perl script, and requires Music::Tag and its dependencies.  Install Music::Tag::MP3, Music::Tag::M4A, etc, based on what formats you want to convert.
It will automatically detect type to use, based on file extension.

I use this to copy metadata, after converting from one format to another.

Usage:

./musictag_copy.pl some_song.m4a some_song.mp3
